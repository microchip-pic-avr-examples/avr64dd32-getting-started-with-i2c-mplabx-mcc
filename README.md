#  Getting Started with Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) Using the AVR64DD32 Microcontroller with MCC Melody

This example shows the basic functionality of the Two-Wire Interface (TWI) peripheral with a basic I<sup>2</sup>C communication, both reading and writing from or to the Client devices using MCC Melody. The device is connected to the PICkit™ Serial I<sup>2</sup>C Demo Board to communicate with the MCP3221 and MCP23008 I<sup>2</sup>C Client devices. The AVR64DD32 first scans the I<sup>2</sup>C bus to discover all devices available on the bus. A message is transmitted through the Universal Synchronous and Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (USART) to indicate the addresses of the devices that respond with the Acknowledge (ACK) signal. A voltage is read by the MCP3221 (equipped with a 12-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)) and the result is transmitted through I<sup>2</sup>C to the AVR64DD32 device. Then, the MCU transmits an 8-bit sequence to the MCP23008, equipped with an I/O Expander, to drive 8 LEDs on an LED bar. The LED display (consisting of 8 LEDs) indicates the potentiometer voltage value (divided in subranges).

## Operation

To program the Curiosity Nano board with this MPLAB® X project, follow the steps provided in the [How to Program the Curiosity Nano Board](#how-to-program-the-curiosity-nano-board) chapter.<br><br>

## Setup

The AVR64DD32 Curiosity Nano Development board is used as the test platform. The 12-bit ADC is used to transmit an analog value.

<br>The following configurations must be made:

|    Pin    |   Configuration    |
| :-------: |   :-----------:    |
| PA2 (SDA) |    Digital I/O     |
| PA3 (SCL) |    Digital I/O     |
| PD4 (TX)  |    Digital output  |

- The AVR64DD32 Microcontroller is connected to the PICkit Serial I<sup>2</sup>C Demo Board as in the figure below:

## Demo

- The software diagram of this application is presented in the figure below:
<br><img src="images/flow-diagram.png" width="250">

- After initializing the I<sup>2</sup>C and USART, the microcontroller will scan the bus to discover the Client devices available. After detecting the devices, a read command and a write command will be performed using those devices. The flow of the application is presented in the figure below:
 <br><img src="images/block-diagram-mcc.png" width="800">

- Visualize the serial output on the terminal window. In this example, the I<sup>2</sup>C device scanning phase is described. The Client devices connected respond with Acknowledge (ACK).

- After turning the potentiometer rotor one way and the other, the LEDs will indicate the level of that voltage, as shown below. 
<br><img src="images/I2C_LED_bar_Result.gif">

- The ADC conversion result is received from the 12-bit ADC I<sup>2</sup>C Client device, it is normalized (obtaining a 3-bit value to be indicated using the 8-LED bar), and the result is transmitted to the 8-bit I/O Expander I<sup>2</sup>C Client device.

## Summary 

This application shows how to use the TWI0 as an I<sup>2</sup>C compatible Host to communicate with two I<sup>2</sup>C Client devices:

- MCP3221 – equipped with a 12-bit ADC
- MCP23008 – equipped with an I/O Expander
